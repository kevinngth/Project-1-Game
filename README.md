### Objectives

Create a turn-based game

* Get familiar with CSS, in particular: Bootstrap
* Problem solving using JavaScript
* Using DOM and/or Ajax to achieve interactivity

### Idea

* turn-based trading game
* start off with some cash
* able to select what to buy from a stack of 3 or 4 items
* after you buy the item it's added to your inventory
* you are able to click on the item to check the price
* after each turn the price of certain things will change
* you can also wait or skip a few turns but if you skip too many turns while holding on to the item in your inventory you may 'spoil', 'expire' or 'lose' the item
* objective is to earn money/ make profit, as much as possible
* shop has rent, every 15th of the month
* day by day, prices change
* 15sec interval for each day
* 3 / 4 days random event that reduce or bonus money e.g. monopoly
* button for next day
* version 1 without mechanics e.g. 1 item either sell or don't
* version 2 able to set price for item
* version 3 price is dependent on demand

Game mechanics (MVP)
* global value for cash
* global value for money
* randomly generated items 
* items price fluctuate according to percentage, generated by random
* 

### Technologies
* Bootstrap 4.3.1

### Approach
### Installation instructions
### Challenges
* Bootstrap
Using bootstrap, a lot of the styles are predetermined and altering one element's class leads to affect another's eventual positioning. Initially wanted to have a masonry styled layout but had difficulty trying to decentralise the alignment. Subsequently realised that instead of 4 different cards, I can have 2 cards in 1 column and another 2 cards in the other column, then change the display for the element that I wanted to be off-center.

Bootstrap was also challenging in the sense that I had to figure out the class attribute that was directly affecting the parameter I wanted to change e.g. margin. It was difficult to see at first but eventually I got the hang of it.
