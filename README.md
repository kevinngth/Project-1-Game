### Objectives

Create a turn-based game

* Get familiar with CSS, in particular: Bootstrap
* Problem solving using JavaScript
* Using DOM and/or Ajax to achieve interactivity

### Idea

* turn-based trading game
* start off with some cash
* able to select what to buy from a stack of 3 or 4 items
* after you buy the item it's added to your inventory
* you are able to click on the item to check the price
* after each turn the price of certain things will change
* you can also wait or skip a few turns but if you skip too many turns while holding on to the item in your inventory you may 'spoil', 'expire' or 'lose' the item
* objective is to earn money/ make profit, as much as possible
* shop has rent, every 15th of the month
* day by day, prices change
* 15sec interval for each day
* 3 / 4 days random event that reduce or bonus money e.g. monopoly
* button for next day
* version 1 without mechanics e.g. 1 item either sell or don't
* version 2 able to set price for item
* version 3 price is dependent on demand

Game mechanics (MVP)
* global value for cash
* global value for money
* randomly generated items 
* items price fluctuate according to percentage, generated by random
*
